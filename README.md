# The Peregrine Currency Trading Platform

## Overview

The Peregrine Currency Trading Platform aims to be the fastest and most robust open source currency trading platform on the planet. 

Peregrine is not a currency trading company. The focus of this project is to create a platform that can be used by anybody that wishes to build on it. 

## Development Methodology

> "Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares."
> Michael Feathers

Great software doesn't just happen. It requires a  disciplined approach. The following methodology is
used to develop Peregrine:

Focus on the core domain and apply Domain Driven Design principles.

Apply Test Driven Development.

Keep the code well structured and clean.

Stand on the shoulders of giants by using existing technology where available.

## Architecture

Use the hexagonal architecture: http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture

Use REST for external interfaces.

## Goals of the Project

# Create a decentralize platform that is resistant to shutdown and DDOS attacks.

# Handle very very large trading volumes with extremely low latency.

# Make it simple to use and easy to leverage.

# Provide support for any currency virtual or non-virtual.

## Why the name Peregrine?

The Peregrine Falcon is renowned for its speed, so is the Peregrine Trading Platform. The Paragrine Falcon can reach
speeds over 322 km/h (200 mph) during its characteristic hunting stoop (high speed dive), making it the fastest member
of the animal kingdom. (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_Falcon)
